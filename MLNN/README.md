# Multi Layer Neural Network & Support Vector Machine

## MLNN

Training a suitable Neural Network (Multi-Layer) with MATLAB to simulate pattern recognition. Once trained, the Neural Network can be used to classify patterns that have not been seen before.

- Dataset used: **iris_dataset** *(Iris flower dataset)*

- Trying different values for:

    1. **Number of Layers**
        - 1 Layer
        - 2 Layers
    2. **Number of Hidden Layers**
        - 5 Hidden Layers
        - 15 Hidden Layers
    3. **Training/Validation/Test Percentages**
        - 60/20/20 Ratio
        - 80/10/10 Ratio

- Recording the *accuracy criteria*, *confusion matrix*, and *ROC curve* in the different cases.

## SVM

Proceeding with the appropriate Support Vector Machine for this example, which is an RBF (**Radial Basis Function**) SVM.

- Recording the *accuracy criteria*, *confusion matrix*, and *ROC curve*
